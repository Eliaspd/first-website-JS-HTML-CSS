          <p>
            Liberica coffee beans, scientifically known as Coffea liberica, are
            one of the four primary species of coffee beans, alongside Arabica
            (Coffea arabica), Robusta (Coffea canephora), and Excelsa (Coffea
            excelsa). While less common and less well-known than Arabica and
            Robusta, Liberica coffee beans have their own unique characteristics
            and are cultivated in specific regions.

                  Liberica coffee is known for its unique and distinct flavor
                  profile. It often has a woody, smoky, and earthy taste with a
                  full body. In summary, Liberica coffee beans are known for
                  their unique and distinct flavor, larger plant size, and
                  suitability for challenging growing conditions. While they are
                  less commonly found in global coffee markets compared to
                  Arabica and Robusta, they remain an important crop in specific
                  regions, and some efforts are underway to promote their
                  cultivation and consumption.
